## 📂 Featured Projects

### 1. ☢️ Nuclear Power Capacity Analysis
📁 `Nuclear power analysis`  
This project models global nuclear capacity trajectories from 1970 to 2050 under four policy scenarios:

- Historical growth
- No new plant construction
- Capacity maintenance (required new builds)
- USA 300% capacity expansion scenario

📈 Key Highlights:
- Plant-level modeling with 60-year lifespans  
- Forecasting capacity under various policy interventions  
- Visualizations using `ggplot2` and `plotly`

🔧 Tools: R, dplyr, lubridate, plotly  
📊 Insight: Without investment, global nuclear capacity drops sharply by 2040—posing energy reliability risks during the renewable transition.

### 2. 💬 IVR System with Generative Language Models
📁 `IVR System with Generative Language Models`  
Built a conversational **IVR (Interactive Voice Response)** system prototype using **OpenAI's GPT models** for enterprise voice automation.

📈 Key Highlights:
- Prompt engineering to simulate realistic multi-turn IVR dialogs  
- Designed fallback + escalation logic for edge cases  
- Mapped conversation flows for banking/telecom applications

🔧 Tools: Python, OpenAI API, Flask  
📊 Use Case: Streamlining voice-based customer service using intelligent, generative responses.

### 3. 💼 Credit Risk Analytics
📁 `Credit risk analytics`  
Developed a credit risk framework for assessing default risk and expected credit losses, aligned with **IFRS 9** standards.

📈 Key Highlights:
- Logistic regression for PD (Probability of Default)  
- Scorecard binning & ROC evaluation  
- Monte Carlo simulations for loss distributions

🔧 Tools: R, Python, scikit-learn, pROC  
📊 Use Case: Suitable for banks and financial institutions managing impairment risk and stress testing.
