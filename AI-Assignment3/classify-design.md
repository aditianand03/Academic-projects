The classifier is a multi-label text classification model using neural networks. It is designed for categorization of textual data into various predefined genres. The training script (TRAIN.PY) first perform preprocessing on the input data, including removing HTML tags, tokenizing the text, and one-hot encoding the target genres. After that, it constructs a neural network model with dense layers, text vectorization, and embedding. Preprocessed data is used to train the model, and an early termination callback is used to avoid overfitting. The program can forecast the genres connected to a given text after training. The trained model is loaded and used by the classify script (CLASSIFY.PY) to predict the genres for an input text. It then returns the top N predicted genres.




The method selected has a neural network structure, which is a deep learning model. This method is recommended for text classification tasks because it can automatically identify complex patterns and correlations in the text data. Semantic information is captured by the embedding layer, while the TextVectorization layer assists in converting text into a numerical format. The softmax activation layers in the output allows multi-label classification. Early stopping in the model prevents overfitting. The model is saved for later use, and the top predicted genres are the output which is written into a JSON file.
