The provided search engine is designed to map TV show information based on a input query file. The system consists of two components: data indexing and search. In the indexing part, it reads dataframe, including descriptions and genres, from an SQLite database. It performs preprocessing like removing HTML tags and lemmatizing the text to enhance search accuracy. The BM25 algorithm is used to index the processed data, making it search-efficient. After a user submits a query, the system tokenizes the question and ranks TV shows according to how relevant they are to the query using BM25. Then, as search results, the most matched TV series are displayed.

The choice to write the search engine in this manner is because by efficiency and accuracy. Data preparation procedures are part of the indexing process, and they enhance the accuracy of the search results.  Removing HTML tags and lemmatizing the text help makes sure that queries match the processed data accurately. BM25 is a reliable and effective information retrieval algorithm, which makes it a good choice for text search applications. Using this indexing, the system then uses user queries to quickly recommend TV shows that are relevant to them. All things considered, this strategy keeps the search engine flexible enough to accommodate future expansions and scalability while optimizing it for precise and effective TV show retrieval.
